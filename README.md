# ASP.NET Core Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of an ASP.NET Core application using the N-Tier Architecture. It incorporates several design patterns and libraries, including FluentValidation, AutoMapper, Unit of Work, and Generic Repository. The application follows a clean and maintainable structure to promote separation of concerns and scalability.

## Project Architecture

The project is structured following the N-Tier Architecture pattern, which divides the application into separate layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Contains the ASP.NET Core Web API controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests and returning HTTP responses.
2. **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic and service interfaces. This layer communicates with the Data Access Layer to perform CRUD operations.
3. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: Contains repositories and unit of work implementations for interacting with the database.
4. **Core Layer**: Contains shared entities, DTOs, and interfaces used across different layers.

## Design Patterns

### N-Tier Architecture

The project is organized into different layers to achieve separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer**: The entry point of the application, handling incoming requests and sending responses.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic, services, and validation logic.
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages database operations using repositories and unit of work.
- **Core Layer**: Contains common entities, interfaces, and DTOs shared across layers.

### Generic Repository Pattern

The Generic Repository pattern is used to define a generic interface for common database operations, such as `Add`, `Update`, `Delete`, and `Get`. This pattern promotes reusability and reduces boilerplate code by encapsulating data access logic into reusable components.

### Unit of Work Pattern

The Unit of Work pattern is used to group multiple database operations into a single transaction. This pattern ensures that all operations within a single unit of work are either committed or rolled back together, maintaining data consistency.

### AutoMapper

AutoMapper is a library used to simplify object-to-object mapping. It is utilized in this project to map entities to DTOs and vice versa, reducing the amount of manual mapping code.

### FluentValidation

FluentValidation is used for validating incoming data models. It provides a fluent interface for defining validation rules, promoting clean and maintainable validation logic.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd yourprojectname
   ```

3. **Restore the project dependencies**:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Update the database connection string in `appsettings.json`**:
   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Your SQL Server Connection String"
   }
   ```

5. **Run the migrations to create the database**:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

6. **Build and run the project**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage

- Use Postman or any HTTP client to test the API endpoints.
- CRUD operations are available for different entities.
- Validation errors will return informative messages based on the FluentValidation rules.
